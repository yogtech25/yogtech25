# How did you decide to use that design and architectural patterns?
Its depend on projects which architectural we can use but now curretly higly used architectural is MVVM and VIPER. Now some details MVVM 
- The MVVM is very attractive, since it combines benefits of the aforementioned approaches, and, in addition, it doesnâ€™t require extra code for the View updates due to the bindings on the View side. Nevertheless, testability is still on a good level.
